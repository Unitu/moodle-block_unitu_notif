This plugin provides the ability to display posts from Unituâ€™s Together We Changed (twc) in Moodle. There are two types of posts which can be viewed with this plugin:
* Feedback from the Board page which has been moved to closed as together we changed.
* Actions created from a Touch Point which have been resolved as together we changed. 
The aim is to make staying informed about university changes easier and more natural for students by incorporating this feature into a platform they use daily.
